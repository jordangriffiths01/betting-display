# betting_display

Program to display betting odds in real time on a large LED screen at horse racing meetings

Parses the data from a web-hosted XML file, loading the data into the custom classes found in classes.py
The main program is run from the betting_display.py file. Repeated_timer.py uses threading to trigger an event every x seconds. Other files consist of various user interface tests.


NB. These are initial concepts to determine viability/client to consider, with development expected to commence mid 2015. Much of the code is tempory (as indicated by comments)
